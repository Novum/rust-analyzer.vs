## Principles

- 100% UI and behavior parity with 'Open Folder' experience for a C# solution with multiple projects.
- Enhance with Rust community best practices e.g. fmt, clippy.
- Killer features e.g. copilot integration.

## Common links

- [Open Folder extensibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/open-folder?view=vs-2022) is pretty much the only documentation apart from the sample code folks have written (see [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements)).
